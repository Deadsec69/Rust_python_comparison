# Concurrent Web Scraper: Rust vs Python Performance Comparison

This project demonstrates the performance differences between Rust and Python when handling concurrent operations, specifically focusing on web scraping with both I/O-bound (URL fetching) and CPU-bound (HTML processing) tasks.

## Performance Results

### Rust Implementation
```
Total fetch time: 3.52 seconds
Total processing time: 0.012 seconds (12ms)
Total execution time: 3.53 seconds

Metrics:
- Fetch: 5 successful requests, 0 failed
- Processing: 4 successful, 1 failed
- Average fetch duration: 1.32s
- Average processing duration: 2.32ms
```

### Python Implementation
```
Total fetch time: 3.56 seconds
Total processing time: 0.06 seconds (60ms)
Total execution time: 3.62 seconds

Metrics:
- Fetch: 3 successful requests, 2 failed
- Processing: 3 successful, 0 failed
- Average fetch duration: 1.29s
- Average processing duration: 14.49ms
```

## Key Observations

1. **I/O-bound Operations (URL Fetching)**
   - Similar performance for both implementations
   - Python performs well because GIL is released during I/O operations
   - Rust shows slightly better reliability (5/5 successful vs 3/5)

2. **CPU-bound Operations (HTML Processing)**
   - Rust is significantly faster (~5x) for processing
   - Python's GIL prevents true parallel processing
   - Rust: 12ms vs Python: 60ms for processing phase

3. **Memory Safety and Thread Management**
   - Rust provides compile-time guarantees
   - Python requires explicit locking (demonstrated in code)
   - Rust's ownership system prevents data races

## Implementation Details

### Rust Features Used
- Tokio for async I/O
- Rayon for parallel processing
- Arc and RwLock for safe concurrency
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Type-safe error handling

### Python Limitations Demonstrated
- Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)
- Thread switching overhead
- Manual synchronization required
- Limited true parallelism

cargo run --release
```

### Python Version

cd concurrent_scraper_py
pip install -e .
python main.py
```

## Conclusions

1. **I/O-bound Tasks**
   - Both languages handle concurrent I/O operations effectively
   - Python's GIL doesn't significantly impact I/O performance
   - Rust shows better reliability and error handling

2. **CPU-bound Tasks**
   - Rust achieves true parallelism with significant performance gains
   - Python's GIL prevents parallel execution of CPU-intensive tasks
   - Processing time difference: Rust is ~5x faster

3. **Development Considerations**
   - Rust provides better safety guarantees at compile time
   - Python requires more careful handling of shared resources
   - Rust's performance advantages come with steeper learning curve

This comparison demonstrates why Rust is often chosen for performance-critical concurrent applications, while Python's threading is more suitable for I/O-bound tasks where the GIL's impact is less significant.
